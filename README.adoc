= ThinkPad Battery Module for NetBSD
Malte Dehling <mdehling@gmail.com>

This is a simple NetBSD kernel module which provides the sysctl variables
`tpbat.charge_start` and `tpbat.charge_stop` by which the charging behavior
of a thinkpad battery can be modified.

Build Instructions
------------------
Place the `tpbat` directory of this repository in the `sys/modules` directory
of your NetBSD source tree and run `nbmake-amd64` from inside.  This should
produce `tpbat.kmod` which you can load with `modload ./tpbat.kmod`.

DISCLAIMER
----------
Use at your own risk.
